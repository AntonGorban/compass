Multi-page adaptive website for a company dealing with moving people to Bulgaria

> This is my first experience with `Bootstrap 4`, `jQuery` and `jQuery solutions`

## Layout

The layout is represented by `psd` files at [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1PDs8-zxVlHbY_TZEx2VPRZ8NA1bAjARQ?usp=sharing) and `jpg` files.

## Technology

Layout is done without using preprocessors, in `HTML`, `CSS` and `JS`.

Responsiveness is implemented using the `Bootstrap 4` grid system.

The positioning of the elements is done with `Bootstrap 4` and `float`.

The jQuery solutions used bxSlider to implement the carousel and arcticModal to implement modal windows.
